            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Saikaeo Chamnanchuea, a passionate Digital Media Engineering student from Khon Kaen University, Thailand.
                I specialize in transforming complex ideas into engaging and informative visual content through graphic design, motion graphics, and UI/UX design.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in digital media began with a deep curiosity about how design influences communication.
                During my internship at BetterPitch, I developed data-driven visual reports that simplified business insights.
                I believe in the power of combining creativity with technology to create impactful user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm always excited to explore new tools, design trends, and opportunities to learn and grow in this fast-changing digital world.
            </p>

                <h3>My Internship at BetterPitch: Turning Data into Design</h3>
                <p><small>March 1, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    As a Graphic Design Intern at BetterPitch in 2024, I had the chance to work on real-world business presentation projects.
                    My main role was to turn complex business data into clean, engaging, and informative infographics. I used Adobe tools like InDesign and Photoshop to design assets that matched the company’s brand and communication goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This internship taught me how to simplify ideas visually and collaborate within a creative team. I also learned how to align design with storytelling — ensuring each visual not only looked good but clearly conveyed the message.
                    It strengthened my belief that design isn't just about decoration — it's about communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working in a real design environment helped sharpen my professional mindset and confirmed that graphic design is more than a skill — it’s a powerful tool for impact.

                <h3>University Activities That Shaped My Creative Thinking</h3>
                <p><small>February 10, 2025</small></p>
                <p>
                    My time at Khon Kaen University has been full of meaningful experiences beyond the classroom. As the team head of Engineering KKU GEAR58 in 2022, I was the coordinator between the student union and engineering students — helping organize and lead creative university events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also participated in the KKU Photo Club, where I contributed to university-wide photography projects. This gave me the chance to express ideas visually, work with others, and build an eye for composition, lighting, and storytelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These activities pushed me to explore visual design in different contexts — from leadership and communication to art and emotion — all of which influence how I design today.
